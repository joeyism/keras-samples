# First Neural Networks with Keras
Take from [Develop Your First Neural Network in Python With Keras Step-By-Step](http://machinelearningmastery.com/tutorial-first-neural-network-python-keras/)

This takes in data, and loads it into X and Y. X is the input, and Y is training output. The depth is very simple: 

```
  o
  o
o o o
o o o
o o o
o o o
o o o o
o o o
o o o
o o o
  o
  o
```

in other words, it's

```
8 - 12 - 8 - 1
```

Then it evalutes the same data, and tests for accuracy
